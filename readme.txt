Embeds Google Picasa Web Flash Slideshow as Widget on Sidebar

== Description ==

This is a plugin written because I could not find something that was as simple and 
configurable as I needed.  This plugin embeds a Flash slideshow (from Google's Picasa 
Web) with the proper configuration parameters.  The actual slideshow can be 
added to your blog within your Widget configuration screen for a specified username
and album ID.

Once the slideshow is in place, it can autostart or not and will open up a new window 
when clicked showing the images in full size within Picasa Web.  The user ID is self-
explanatory along with most of the options available for configuration.  The album ID
is a long number (about 19 digits) and can be retrieved from the slide show link
within Picasa Web Albums or the "Embed Slideshow" link that appears once you have selected an album
within your account.  The background color is the background color desired for the slideshow
and is represented by 6 hexadecimal digits.

A description of the slideshow created is available from this Google Picasa Web Albums
[post](http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=66969 "Slideshow description").
