Embeds Google Picasa Web Flash Slideshow as Widget on Sidebar

== Description ==

This is a plugin written because I could not find something that was as simple and 
configurable as I needed.  This plugin embeds a Flash slideshow (from Google's Picasa 
Web) with the proper configuration parameters.  The actual slideshow can be 
added to your blog within your Widget configuration screen for a specified username
and album ID.

Once the slideshow is in place, it can autostart or not and will open up a new window 
when clicked showing the images in full size within Picasa Web.

A description of the slideshow created is available from this Google Picasa Web Albums
[post](http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=66969 "Slideshow description").

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the 'Picasa Slideshow' widget within the 'Widgets' menu in Wordpess
4. Change configuration parameters to match your Picasaweb user ID and album ID.
